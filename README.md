# Bug's Life AI repository

This AI Engineering Computer Vision Service is intended to be a complete insightful source of detection in insects world, 
Futhermore, it has the purpose of bringing a business differential advantage to the Bug's Life application.


## Insect Binary Classifier

This model pretends to recognize and automatically identify if an insect exists or not in a given image.

 The first objective was reached in which a deep learning model was trained successfully, The model was deployed on [Render](render.com) through Docker, Flask, Starlette.


## Second Model

This model pretends to recognize species, families and orders of the insect world.

1- Get Dataset (Concluded)

2- Image Segmentation (In progress)

## ToDo

1- Apply Data Augmentation on Images
2- Train the Deep Learning Model
3- Hyper-parameter Tuning
4- Evaluate with Real tests
5- Deploy and continuous sustaining of service
