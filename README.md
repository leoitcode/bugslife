# Bug's Life AI repository

This AI Engineering Computer Vision Service is intended to be a complete insightful source of detection through of a  Convolutional Neural Network Classificator. 
Furthermore, it has the purpose of bringing a business/educational differential advantage to the Bug's Life application.


## Insect Binary Classifier (complete)

This model recognizes and automatically identify if an insect exists or not in a given image.

 The first objective was reached in which a deep learning model was trained successfully, The model was deployed on [Render](render.com) through Docker, Flask, Starlette.


## Second Model (in progress)

This model pretends to recognize species, families and orders of the insect world.

1- Get Dataset (Concluded)

2- Image Segmentation (In progress)

Applying techniques like Mask R-CNN and Active contour model, I'm researching how the best way to achieve good instance and semantic segmentations.

## ToDo

1- Apply Data Augmentation on Images  
2- Train the Deep Learning Model  
3- Hyper-parameter Tuning  
4- Evaluate with Real tests  
5- Deploy and continuous sustaining of service
